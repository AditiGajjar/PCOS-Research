0,s379ci,21,Under 200lbs for the first time in 2 years! 🥳,PCOS,"After gaining over 30lbs in 2020 and finally getting diagnosed with PCOS, I am finally under 200 pounds (198 today!) for the first time in two years.

2,s2dmng,35,Had a bit of an embarrassing incident during my metformin journey.,PCOS,"I’ve had an on-off relationship with metformin, the side effects just took their toll on me a lot. But I think I’ve finally figured out how to manage it with the right supplements and regimens. So I got back on metformin a month ago when I noticed that AN had kicked in, and I’m at 2000mg a day atm.

Now I know weight loss is a common side effect, and I expected a gradual change in weight with time. What happened next is *definitely* not something I expected though.

Today was cleaning day, and as I go into the kitchen to take out the trash, my house cleaner came in to ask where I’d moved the mop. I’d just stood up to turn around and tell her when all of a sudden……. my pants are on the floor. She suddenly gasps and turns around and I just quickly pull them back up thoroughly embarrassed and run to my room to change. Thankfully she found it hilarious when I came back and told me not to worry. But that was when I went to check my weight and indeed I’d dropped around 5kg in the last month.

So yeah, just thought I’d share this anecdote in my metformin journey, that’s all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/s2dmng/had_a_bit_of_an_embarrassing_incident_during_my/,91,"I'm amazed at people sucess stories with this medication regarding weight loss.

7,s5e4nv,15,Is sugar what's making it hard for me to lose weight? Sudden weight loss,PCOS,"I've been losing weight at a slower rate than I thought was realistic with my strict 1.4k - 1.6k per day. I work out 3 times a week with significant strength results and do 4 days of walking, a totaling my weight loss at 30lbs from the last 10 months: however, I have plateaued heavily I the last 4. 

It is believed I have slight insulin resistance and started metormin 2 months ago. I lost 5 lbs in 10, but it wasn't significant at just an average of .5 lbs per week. Last week, I cut out all sweets and sugars, even if they're in within my calories. BAM--I lost 3.5 lbs at the same calories! Was the sugar making the metformin not work? This is insane, but I don't want to speak too soon.

8,s9dih3,18,Is insulin resistance the reason why weight loss is near impossible?,PCOS,"I’m not officially diagnosed with PCOS because, frankly, the gynecological healthcare where I live isn’t so good unless we’re talking about fertility treatments (and I am not looking to get pregnant any time soon). But I have hirsutism, irregular periods, lots of chin acne at 26 despite taking ok care of my skin etc. I take the pill to both prevent pregnancy & to moderate emotionally volatile periods. 

I gained almost 100 lbs after taking lexapro in the span of 2 years and despite every effort, I haven’t been able to lose any weight at all. Pre-lexapro I was 135 lbs, now 3 years later I’m 240. And every time I’ve tried to do a caloric deficit, the scale wouldn’t move for at least a month, and even then, after 3-4 weeks or so, I’d lose like 3 lbs max. I’ve tried seeing nutritionists, but they always kind of seemed overworked and would say “just eat less”, even if this has been very hard to do consistently. I don’t know if it was like I never had to care before about what I ate, but since going on and then off lexapro I’m just hungry and craving stuff constantly. I’ve made so many 1-2 month long attempts at caloric deficits, weighing my food and everything, only for the scale to just barely budge. At this point my cravings would win over the logical side of me who knows weight loss would be good for me. 

And I can’t seem to find any stories about weight loss that takes several weeks to get going, almost everyone seems to have rapid weight loss already the first week of maintaining a caloric deficit. I’ve done blood tests before, when the weight first rapidly piled on, that showed no signs on metabolic syndrome. Even now the only markers that are abnormal for me are C-RP and blood pressure, everything else is fine. So, is my story typical for PCOS-induced insulin resistance? What has helped you finally lose weight? I also just ordered an inositol supplement, might this help?

16,rpfuqu,18,So where do I go from here?,PCOS,"G'day fellow Cysters,

&#x200B;

I've been travelling along with my PCOS diagnosis for about 8 years now .

Over this time I've seen my weight climb from 70kgs to a peak of 102 kgs (154lbs - 224lbs)

I am currently at 88kgs (194lbs) - I eat very healthy, track food, work out daily. I've been seeing a PT for about a year, I've seen dieticians and nutritionists and they've always sent me away happy with my diet. I do Aerial Hoop 2-3 times a week (roughly 6-8hrs a week), gym 3 times a week (3-4hrs) and then walk/run every day for around 30-45min with my dog. Yet the weight doesn't budge. 

I am seeing no loss in cms or fat anywhere and its beyond infuriating.

I've been having a LOT of bouts of serious fatigue and exhaustion over the past month which has slowed me down, mentally and physically.  I am so tired of having to work so painfully hard only for there to be fuck all results?

I've been on metformin for years, and have tried Phentermine (made me so nauseous) with little to no luck. All blood tests I've done have come back fine over the years, the only recent one telling me I'm on the lower end of normal for Vit D (started supplements for that)

&#x200B;

What advice do you all have and what have you tried to actually get this stubborn fat to disappear???  
I've thought about surgical options, but to be honest I don't even know if that would help.

Targeting IR makes all the difference. What might be healthy for some is often not healthy when there is IR and if you have PCOS and are overweight, you have IR. Insulin is the hormone that tells the body to store fat. Reversing IR can take time but doing so lowers the risk for NAFLD, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, so, big dividends. It can also reduce or even reverse PCOS symptoms.

Your blood work should give you an idea of what’s up with you and where to start your focus.

For me, I had ALL of these. In order to get to a point where my body would “let” me lose weight, I had to spend a long time (like 3-6 months!) on a low-carb/low-glycemic Mediterranean diet, do yoga every morning, do moderate cardio 3 times per week, take inositol, and take vitamin D.

24,rnlzue,15,Weight gain but no insulin resistance?,PCOS,"Last week, after months of seeing different doctors, tons of tests, I’ve received my final PCOS diagnosis.
I have elevated testosterone levels (almost twice the norm) but my insulin and blood sugar levels are perfectly fine.
I’ve always been a slim person (had periods when I was very skinny) but in the last three months I’ve observed a slight weight gain - I’ve gone up from 58 to 60/61 kilograms.
While I know that this could be attributed to lifestyle changes - I’ve started grad school and my eating habits have changed (I snack a lot more, eat more sweets, went back to eating meat after years of being vegetarian) I just can’t stop stressing that it might be because of PCOS. I just started treatment to lower my testosterone and I know that the weight gain has been almost minimal and that the rational thing would be to attribute it to the changes in my diet; still, there is this constant anxiety that this is because of PCOS and I will just keep gaining weight.

I put on like 45 pounds in a year, it was crazy. I was never tiny, but I am now significantly heavier than I ever was in High School. 

Now my top priority is losing weight and reversing PCOS symptoms but I’m struggling so badly. I’ve tried losing weight in the past, but the binging and cravings mixed with my ADD made it feel impossible to stick to. 

Now, I’m super motivated. I’m on ovasitol, I tried doing gluten and dairy free. That helped for a bit and I lost 10 pounds but then it stopped and I couldn’t get my body to shed anymore weight. I know some people talk about Keto but I know it’s not good long term and I could see myself gaining all the weight back after I stop - not to mention how strict it is.

There was a time where I was at a low weight but I began binge eating and now I’m at my highest weight. Did I cause PCOS because of my weight gain? And I’ve read that it’s harder to lose weight. Does that mean even if I were to eat less calories than I burn I would not lose weight? I’m sorry for the dumb questions. Thank you for reading my text :),https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rzampw/my_doctor_just_told_me_i_have_pcos_and_i_have_a/,6,"PCOS is more likely the reason why you are experiencing binge eating and weight gain. (NOTE: YOU DID NOT CAUSE YOUR PCOS!!!) PCOS is driven by insulin resistance, which means your body can’t utilize sugar as energy very well. This is why you can eat a full meal but still feel hungry- your body thinks it hasn’t received enough energy because it can’t use it efficiently.

Hormone imbalances are another aspect of PCOS. This is why it can be difficult to lose weight, even if you workout a lot and eat very few calories. Hormones take a looooong time to heal, so it can take a year or more to balance them before you can see your body begin to respond to a calories in/calories out weight loss plan.

The key to hormone repair and insulin management is to include protein, fat, and fiber with all your meals and snacks. I highly recommend the podcasts “Food Freedom Fertility” and “The PCOS Nutritionist.” I got diagnosed in 2020 and spent the first year listening to every single episode of these shows and I learned so much about how to manage my illness. Another good podcast is “Maintenance Phase,” which isn’t about PCOS but has helped me work through my fat phobia. I also love @pcos.positivity on Instagram.

39,rwvo3g,4,Borderline underweight and losing fat with metformin - help!,PCOS,"Hello! Thank you for being here, thank you for reading my post, and I hope you're having a good day!

After 10 years of dealing with PCOS, I'm used to feeling uncomfortable and distraught most of the time. But the latest problem is giving me even more anxiety than usual. 

In June, my endocrinologist put me on metformin for the first time because I'm trying to get pregnant. I think it's helped me in a number of ways, but I noticed recently that I've lost 2 lbs.  This may not sound like a lot to the average person, and would be welcome news for many. But I'm in the minority of PCOS patients who are lean -- in my case, too lean. My BMI is 19.4 and I have a really hard time gaining weight, probably because of the androgens, anxiety, and gut issues. 

I've felt myself losing the little fat I have on my lower half over the past few months, and I absolutely hate it! I feel like my muscles are tighter, too. This might be because fat is important for muscle protection(?). 

I'm finding this incredibly hard to live with in a body image sense. Not to mention, I *need* the fat if I'm to keep any precarious fertility I do have. I simply cannot afford to keep losing weight. I'm still eating the same amount and the same foods.

Has anyone had a similar experience, and did you figure out how to gain weight on Metformin? A lot of advice for underweight people tends to be, ""Just eat more,"" but it's hard to go against your appetite, and I'm not even sure what to eat! I'm already getting a normal amount of fats, carbs, protein, fiber, etc. I've reduced exercise and still feel weak and do not have enough fat on my body.

I then moved and my new doctors didn't want to put me on Metformin again for 6 years until 6 months ago (becauseI proved I had done everythingin my power for weightloss...twisted), I now take 1000mg/day, I used to take 2000mg/day.

I need to lose weight, but I can't bring myself to restrict my eating again. I work with a therapist but I wanted to see if anyone else had lived through something similar on this sub.

From feb 2019 to sep 2021 I followed a diet with a very nice dietitian (I moved countries so I couldn't go back to my old nutritionist). I would lose 4kg then gain 3kg back as soon as I was a bit stressed, or couldn't go running for a month due to work, all this without my food intake changing. It was up and down a lot and I overall plateaud a lot. To try and retrigger weightloss we tried IF. It broke me. When I was a kid I had 1 year where I was skipping lunch due to reasons that had to do with adult negligence (school staff, not my parents). I had not realised how traumatic that had been and IF totally retriggered that trauma. Even after I stopped IF, I was obsessed with food and afraid of not having enough food all the time. This lead me to binge, I was still trying to diet though not doing IF anymore, but it was impossible. That's why I stopped the diet in September and started addressing topics linked to my eating habits and to this trauma with my therapist.

The thing is, I need to lose weight. I can't keep eating how I eat (reasonably but too much for my PCOS) also because I'm starting to have other symptoms like acne and painful inflammation in my gut.

I've managed to reduce my binging, my therapist is magic, I'm now dealing with other diktats that are engrained in me and force me to ignore my hunger, but how do I start eating less again?

Have any of you had to diet despite food/diet trauma? What helped?

Where could I post this? I only found weightloss subs which are not what I need, or ED subs and it seems insensitive to post there also becauseaccordingto my therapist what I have is not an ED, it's trauma and emotional pain. 

Do you know a forum or page, even outside of Reddit?

First of all, virtual hugs!  🥺❤️

I totally understand what you are going through and it's hard to be in this position and having the guilt of eating you know you are not supposed to eat.

For me something that has recently helped me with cravings and as I hear helped other people too was supplementation with inositol (4000mg Myo-inositol and 50mg Chiro-inositol). 

Along with this... adding protein to every diet helps me get full sooner than later. More fiber rich and good fats like extra virgin olive oil also helps. Vegetables are a great source of fiber. Oats, brown rice, lentils, chick pea, beans can be good source of fiber and are also great complex carbs. What happens is when we add more nutrition to our meal...our bodies feel more satisfied and we they crave less for food. It's somewhat like binging is our bodies way of telling us it needs nutrition...but lack of nutrition in unhealthy food just starts a binging cycle in itself instead.

Furthermore, you are beautiful at every size! Your body will lose weight when it can.. it's alright it's hard to lose weight on PCOS and it's important to appreciate our bodies in every shape (Trust me I have my hard days as well...maybe more often than I would like to have them..but that's why I understand your struggle).

[A small post to cheer you up!  ❤️](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHnl1Owhr7L/?utm_medium=copy_link)

I would suggest try to focus on giving your body more nutrition while moving your body in whatever way you like..sooner or later weight loss will follow. Good luck with your journey and you can text me in PM if you ever need to talk to someone. ❤️ ",2021-12-09 07:35:12

I have increasing anxiety as in two weeks, I go to a drs appt. I have to get blood tests done Thursday and I’m terrified and upset. Maternal side has a history of PCOS that was diagnosed in 20’s, im 22 now. I know it’s basic blood work but they added 3 tests for me, (not TSH, only if my labs prove abnormal)

Symptoms (I think?)

-late menarche, thought to be because I was born early. I started at 16, and my mother and grandmother started around 12, my cousin on maternal side started at 8. 
-at 19, I got on depo because my periods were irregular. I would skip a month, have anywhere from 7-14 day long periods, heavy. I also would have anywhere from 7-35 days between bleeding. 

-At 22, I went from 115 lbs to 160lbs in 3 mos after 3 years of depo. 2 years into depo, I got periods every 2 mos. Had to take a pregnancy test, negative. I switched to Kyleena and it helped my recently diagnosed IBS-CIC. (At 20 after 20 years of suffering)

-the last year, I’ve told my dr about 2 instances where I’m positive I had a cyst rupture, I now get the searing pain and symptoms either the 1-2 day of bleeding. I’m having 2 wk long cycles but 3 days of bleeding, rest is heavy to light spotting. 

after a year, I finally hit 147lbs. Just this December. I started my period on Dec 28, still heavy spotting. Now I’m at 165 & I do eat but.. I have no appetite. I do exercise but I’m just scared. How do I ask for testing for PCOS, what can I expect? Is it possible that IBS is also causing issues, or they’re comorbidities? Anyone else have any resemblance to what I’m experiencing?

I do workout 1-2x wk due to my work (healthcare) but it seems to cause gastro flareups.. cut out carbs/alcohol/no fast food for last 7 mos where I can and meal prep, more protein/fiber..

My mother and sister also have PCOS in what I might consider more ""typical"" presentations - frequent cysts, irregular heavy cycles, overweight, pre-diabetic, etc. I suppose I have ""lean"" PCOS - I've always been very underweight, amenorrhoeic, acne & high androgrens, etc.

I'm 5'10"" and have never weighed more than 115 lbs. I usually find it difficult to meet even a basic 1,200 daily calorie intake, much less 1,500+ to put on some weight, simply because I'm never hungry enough! And can't eat too much in one sitting. I'm sure some people may wish for these problems and the grass is always greener. Regardless I am really making a concerted effort towards better overall health and for me personally that includes gaining strength, stamina, and weight.

Of course the easiest way to meet a caloric surplus would be carbs, but my doctor is recommending a keto diet or similar to help with all the PCOS symptoms, and hoping to get my cycle back (haven't had a normal one in 10 years). I'm really struggling with finding the balance between these two opposing needs for my health! And frankly I'm just not well versed enough in nutrition. Additionally I'm moving on from yoga to strength exercises and it's crucial I get more food and energy in this body!

So, all that being said, would love any tips from other folks who may have or still struggle with gaining weight and fighting off the PCOS symptoms, whether it's diets or supplements or whatever works for you.

If you are going lower carb I recommend figuring out a fat-protein ratio with emphasis on changing your fuel from cabs to fat, becoming fat adapted. You might still lose some in this transition, but after a while you might also gain. What made me not able to eat was NAFLD. The symptoms completely resumed, in my case after maybe 1 year of going zercarb (carnivore). I discovered I actually don't tolerate plant fats, and most stuff that oils are made of (except for coconut oil). Malnutrition created a lot of other issues, that got resolved in time (hair thinning, anemia, brain fog). Hormones got better too, I don't get the perpetual jaw acne, period stabilized (was having semi-regular prolonged and painful bleeding and clots - not anymore!).

After almost 3 years I'm stable at 112 lbs without effort, have an appetite, and don't lose weight, even if I don't eat for a day or two. In the past, not eating for a day resulted in almost 2lbs loss and I couldn't eat for 2-3 days because of a NAFLD flare.

You can also ask your doctor for appetite enhancers if your weight drops dangerously low (not that it isn't dangerously low right now). I had to rely on such treatment and it worked out fine. Initially I lost 4 pounds in the first days of this way of eating and it was also hard to pass my 1200-1400 kcal threshold I've been used to for at least 1 decade, without the carbs, so the treatment helped with that. I can do 2000kcal and can fill my stomach to the brim and not get sick. I rarely do that though, that's why I'm stuck at 112. I also don't have clothes that would fit me beyond 112 (yet). :(

60,r95h7b,10,"Holidays approaching, how to address weight gain with family?",PCOS,"Hi all,

\*long story, TLDR at the bottom\*  

I've gained 100lbs since my husband(24M) and I(27F) got married 4 years ago, 65 lbs of it being since Dec 2020 when I stopped taking hormonal birth control. 

My mother in law had a weight loss surgery the WEEKEND I met my husband, so she's been smaller every time I see her since I met her. (She has maintained her weight loss and is doing well) 

We live in Texas and went to CA to visit my husband's family in March 2021, I'd obviously gained some weight since stopping the HBC. My MIL pulled me aside and shared her entire story about her relationship with food and her weight... how her first marriage wasn't going well and her weight gain was very emotional and expressed concern for me. I responded with, ""Thanks so much for sharing. I have hormonal imbalances and have stopped taking birth control, this is the reason behind my weight gain."" 

We are going to visit for Christmas and I've gained another 30-40 lbs since March... I haven't had a period since February which makes it difficult to get pregnant. I just started taking Metformin. I spend $100+/month on vitamins and supplements(including inositol) and attend crossfit 4-6x/week. I'm very aware of my body size and doing my best to take care of things. Thinking about starting using the RP diet/app in January 2022 and beginning fertility meds in Feb/March 2022. 

I was already concerned about seeing them in December knowing the conversation my MIL and I had in March last time I saw her. Today my husband brought up that his mom asked him a while ago, ""Your wife has gained a lot of weight since you've been married... are you being nice to her and taking care of her?"" My husband was like dude. We're doing well and my wife is happy. 

So now I'm trying to figure out... do I reach out to my MIL (and my husband's 3 sisters) ahead of time and just get it over with? Let them know, ""Hey I know I'm heavy, it's out of my control. I'm doing what I can and please don't ask us when we're having kids."" Or do I not say anything and then set boundaries/answer questions if it comes up in person? And try not to be too concerned thinking they're talking about me behind my back? 

Has anyone had any experience with a similar situation? It's so tricky. 

TLDR : MIL has history of emotional eating, connects weight gain to poor quality of life. That's not the case with PCOS and much of my weight gain is out of my control. Do you try to get ahead of it and say something before we go visit for Christmas? Or hope they don't say anything when we visit, but be prepared for if they do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/r95h7b/holidays_approaching_how_to_address_weight_gain/,5,"So you actually sound like you could have Cushings Disease, which is OFTEN misdiagnosed as PCOS (happened to me) do ANY of these symptoms resonate with you/sound like you?

Here’s my question - what am I missing? What in pregnancy made my health so much better and effortless, literally, to lose weight. I know it’s not all about weight but I genuinely felt so much healthier and now I’m back to feeling sluggish and am gaining. 


Has anyone else had this experience? And if so, is there some hormone that PCOS woman lack that pregnancy makes up for and how can we duplicate it post-partum.

64,r85tfv,9,Odd abdominal distension?,PCOS,"I was diagnosed at 15 and am now 20. I admittedly have a shit diet and eat high carb, mainly because I’m at college in a smaller town in the Midwest and we have very little food options.

I was always extremely thin due to competitive athletics, basically slightly underweight. I struggled with an ED when I quit my senior year of high school and became extremely underweight. I gained 20 pounds my first year of college, lost 5 pounds of it over the summer when I came home and fixed my diet, and now I gained that back.

Like 3-4 months pregnant, constantly, and by the end of the day my stomach is always in terrible pain. I haven’t changed pant sizes or even look that much different in clothes, but I literally always look like I’m carrying a bowling ball in my lower stomach. I’m not pregnant to my knowledge (I haven’t had PIV sex without a condom in nearly a year, and I have a hormonal IUD). Even when I was closer to underweight, I still looked like that.

66,rcg4zz,15,My brother just gave me the best 30-minute speech of my entire life! What do you guys think?,PCOS,"Boy oh boy. I don't know how to react right now. I don't know whether to cry my eye sockets out right now or stay awake or have lucid dreams. I am jaw-dropped and absolutely speechless right about now. My brother has to be a motivational speaker. He just gave me some tough motherfucking love right now, and it was the best words I have ever heard come out of his mouth, in my 22 years of existing on this planet with him. I WISH I had it on tape, because I never in my years of existence thought that my brother would be capable of saying such strong words. I swear I will NOT sleep tonight, which is horrible because I need it.




So I am pretty obese. I weigh over 200 pounds and am 5'6"". To make matters worse, I have a hormonal imbalance, which means that I need to work EXTRA hard to lose weight. My brother and mother have both been going hard on me about my weight for the past 4 years that I have been overweight. I would always not want to hear it and would think that they were being rude. And I would always say that I have a hormonal imbalance, so they don't understand what I go through. Yet here I am, eating fast food every motherfucking day (sometimes twice in one day, I know, I'm the world's biggest psychopath) and getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger (good lord let me stop saying ""bigger"", shall I?). And I would honestly use it as an excuse. Yes, having a hormonal imbalance makes it a million times more difficult to lose weight, but that does not under ANY circumstances make it impossible! Not to mention, I work at Domino's. Also with PCOS (the hormonal imbalance syndrome I have) I get HUNGRY AS FUCCCKKKK! But guess what? Eating fast food every day only exacerbates the problem! It is the WORST thing you can do for PCOS! Weight loss is harder for me than the average person. But I need to suck it the FUCK up and just get to fucking exercising and strict dieting already!




My brother told me all of this, though in words a million times better than mine and that I WISH I had recorded. Not only that, but my brother has a facial deformity. He has to go through HELL to get it fixed. He has went through 20 hours of surgeries in his face and NONE of them worked. He said that he has no more sympathy for me having PCOS because he has a facial deformity, something that he cannot fix on his own. I can completely control my weight and how I eat. So he said ""either you take working out and dieting seriously, or you stay the way you are and get a heart attack and die at an early age. Your choice. You don't get to complain about your weight anymore. Enough is enough."" 





Man, when I tell you my brother has a mouth that can get realer than anyone else on the face of this planet. My brother does NOT fuck around. And the crazy thing is that we were playing around and calling each other ""dicks"", and he told me to give him an example of a time that he was being a dick. And my ass had the nerve to tell him about when he yelled at me because I was yelling at him to never bring my weight up again. Right before were calling each other dicks, we were watching fucking YouTube videos! So a COMPLETE 360 degrees in topic! Oh well! Me bringing that up was a blessing!





He even said that he can be my personal trainer and give me a workout plan and a strict diet to follow! I am just SCARED! Because he will literally monitor me at all times that he is in the house. And since this is a a STRICT diet, no more ice cream. No more cookies. No more cake. No more soda. No more of the snacks that I love to eat. It's like either I go into a cold turkey diet, or I am not taking losing weight seriously. That scares the FUCK outta me! I don't know what my brother will try to do! I'm afraid that he is going to be a bully if I fuck up! I feel like he is going to beat me up emotionally and mentally if I have just one cookie! Because this guy does not fuck around! Oh man! I want him to be my personal trainer, but I am TERRIFIED!!! 





So yeah. My brother's words can get deeper than anyone else's that has ever walked this Earth. It's fucking horrifying, yet beautiful at the same time. I have to wake the fuck up and stop with these horrible eating habits that are taking away my life slowly. Sorry if I got too dramatic here, and if I ramble a lot, but I am just in shock and in awe right now that my brother is capable of such real, powerful words!

But it is not impossible. You have to find what works best for you. Some strategies help, but you are probably better off figure it out alone (or with a GOOD doc help) than letting your brother take full control of your diet. For me personally, I rather restrict some food (grains, refined carbs in general) than restrict calories on purpose. I hate restricting calories. I like to eat until I feel satisfied. And often when I don't eat refined carbs such as bread, and eat a LOT of fat instead, I don't ever eat at a calorie surplus. I'm atm weighting 66kg from more than 80kg before. And while I did count calories at the start of my journey and it worked, I stopped that. I can't be bother being hungry. My fav food atm is pork skin. I ate like almost half a kg alone some days ago because I was soooo hungry and I'm still losing weight...soooo. Being hungry no more. Cba, cba, cba, cba starving to death just so I can eat bread and rice. No, thanks. Enough torture for a lifetime.

When my PCOS was rampant I was at 60kg, 168cm, and I felt bloated + had a face full of acne. (I'm asian so any excess weight goes straight to my face). I craved carbs 24/7 and would eat whole loaves of bread.

Next check in with my bariatric doctor. I begin the next dosage level of Wygovey starting tomorrow. I believe it's just a jump from 0.50mg to 0.75mg. 

Week 1 Weight: 250 lbs

Week 5 Check in: 259lbs, down 1% body fat  
 (NOTE, I also had an IUD inserted and according to my OBGYN, it's not surprising to see my body, especially with PCOS, retaining water while it adjusts to this new IUD. IT can take up to 6 months for this to settle and go away but it's all WATER weight).   


Week 9 Check in: 259lbs, flat. No body fat comp taken  
We only take the body composition ever other week but we are now going to also take measurements on my waist, thighs, and stomach. But she said she could notice my face is already thinning out even though my weight stayed the same. I also now actually feel... ""fullness"" and am down to about 2 meals a day and maybe a snack. That's pretty big for me as someone who always had room for no food

&#x200B;

More soon but right now what I've noticed on wygovey:

1. As someone with no gallbladder, eating anything fatty or greasy made my stomach hurt and bathroom trips felt urgent. Now, the medicine can make me constipated the first two days after the injection. I highly recommend taking a probiotic to help your body along
2. I'm noticing my clothes feel a little looser

Lack of nutrients can make PCOS even worse. Are you being followed by a doctor? You can always try a low carb/low sugar diet. Carbs like potatoes, breads and pastas you want to limit.

Keep table sugar stuff like soda, cookies, cakes and sweets to a VERY bare minimum. Cut it out completely if you're able. 

The food you consume is what your body uses for energy, so vastly cutting your amount of food intake is NEVER a good idea. You're going to make your PCOS worse on top of making you malnourished.

89,rgkzks,4,Birth Control and Weight Gain Theory,PCOS,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve had a PCOS diagnosis for about 5 years now. I’ve been on birth control since then and rapidly packed on the weight. In the past year I got weight loss surgery in hopes to lose weight and eliminate PCOS symptoms. My theory is that PCOS is making it impossible to lose weight. 

I was losing weight great of course in the beginning due to surgery but took 4-6 months off birth control as well. This surgery increases your fertility significantly so by 6 months I was back on my birth control patch. Since then, I HAVE NOT LOST ANY WEIGHT. I keep balancing between the same 5 pounds. 

I eat right, about 1200-1500 calories a day, work out 3-5 times a week with a mixture of strength training and cardio for 45 minutes to an hour.

I also like to stay busy so I’m always moving around and cleaning organizing. I don’t watch much TV. 

Yet I keep gaining weight. No changes in my diet over the past few years. Pretty much the same. I’m a really picky eater. I also used to have a really bad eating disorder so I can essentially calculate every calorie I consume without having to write it down. I know I’m not over indulging too much.

I’ve tried to diet but it doesn’t help much. Maybe a little with my bloating. 

I know it’s because my PCOS and it’s stressing me out because I know as I get older it’s only getting worse.

I can happily say I’m recovered from my eating disorder and I love my body! I love how I look. I honestly only want to lose weight to help with my joint pain and I have COPD so I just want to be healthier. If I can lose weight and get healthier and my body didn’t change I’d be fine.

I try to address any upticks in the scale, I used to not do so and it would get a lot harder to turn around. Exercise is great for health but weight is primarily what we eat and how often. With PCOS, an increase in  weight often signifies insulin resistance increasing, and since that is linked to not only PCOS, but diabetes, NAFLD, mood disorders, heart disease, some cancers and Alzheimer's, it is important to keep it in check.

**I have a sedentary lifestyle that can't easily be changed due to diagnosed chronic fatigue ALONG WITH a physical disability.**

I've done a good job at maintaining my weight at 1,200 calories a day with minimal exercise...but since 2016, I have not been able to shed an extra 10lbs unless I drop to 800 calories a day, and I pretty much feel like death if I do that. I can drop a couple pounds a week, but *the second* I go above 800, I put them back on again.

The past 6 months I've been going through something extremely emotional, so I've been stress eating for a while. I **gained** 10 pounds. For the past 3 months I've been trying to lose it but without success... Again, I'm maintaining the current weight at 1,200 a day... Not losing that new 10 pounds...

So, since I've struggled since 2016 to drop 10lbs, **everyone** is completely confused on how I can't lose the weight with ""how
little"" I'm always eating and how I obsessively calories track all the time.

So now I can't lose 20lbs with that added 10lbs I gained from the stress period.

Again... Everyone is confused as to why, as I literally use My Fitness Pal.

The conclusion **everyone** comes to is because I eat at night, a couple hours before bed.

However, I'm not exceeding my 1,200 calories with the ""night eating""... I purposely eat very little during the day and save 600-800 calories for my biggest meal at night.

I do this because **I cannot sleep if I feel hungry**.

I've done extreme trial and error over the years about this, as I suffered from ""insomnia"" along with the chronic fatigue since childhood... Pills and the likes never worked... And turns out I can't sleep if I don't feel full.

Reading around on the Lose It sub reddit, the time you eat should not matter as long as you're keeping your daily calorie intake stable.... Right??

So I'm wondering if this is another thing having PCOS screws with... Like if we eat at night, do our bodies not process the calories the same way because the moon is out?

It's not like I'm doing that much more movement during the day as I am when sleeping... Hell, I probably get up the same amount from my desk with my bed due to how much I have to use the bathroom when I lay down.

Im really struggling with weight loss with PCOS/IR. I am fortunate enough that I have a normal cycle, I managed the hair growth with laser treatment and I have full long hair and could treat my acne nicely with a good skin care routine. But being obese is a nightmare and I am always so, so, so tired and still trying but I´m desperate. 

However, when it comes to weight loss, I feel like I am at the end of my wits. **Please note, I don´t want to hear the usual clichés, I want to hear how YOU DID IT. I am generally a very well-read and well-informed person and trust me, what I could Google and consult with experts, doctors IRL, I have done it all.**

Dietician, doctor, personal trainer, intermittent fasting, keto, low carb, high protein, whatever you name, I have tried and did stick with it wholeheartedly, so there is no lack of effort there. Even before PCOS, I could lose significant weight with cardio, weights and a balanced protein-heavy healthy diet - which, due to me gaining weight easily, I have always observed since my early 20s and I could keep the weight down until one day I started ballooning up and ballooned to my current weight in about half a year.

Im nearing 32 now and all the effort, cooking, planning, diets, 7/6-7/7 training I put into it doesn´t seem to work. Even if I lose a few water pounds, it fluctuates back immediately. The only thing that could make me lose a few pounds was basically a prolonged, 3-month fast (yes, you read that right), just to convince you of my level of desperation.

I read all the blogs (yeah, lifestyle change, adrenal health, eat whole carbs, sleep good, do yoga, yadda yadda know it all, yes), even searched through medical journals whatever to find something evidence-based or hands-on to establish a strategy, a method that could finally START my weight loss.

Currently, I am 175 cm high and around 125-132 kgs, my first goal would be go below 100 to be able to have a kid and survive pregnancy and birth. Since all the weights made me quite muscular (thanks, testosterone), my goal weight is about 80-85 kg, I would not dream of any lower now, even below 100 is unimaginable.

**What worked for you at the end of the day?**

**DOES A WORKING METHOD EXIST AT ALL???????**

PS: It seems all the weight loss success stories I read are just the result of gastric surgery and I want to avoid that at all costs and keep it as a last last last last resort if I won´t be able to lose pregnancy weight like my mother couldn´t after kids.

It's going to happen before you know it. Until then, go to the gym and be proud of yourself for taking good care of yourself and pushing your limits in all ways. It really isn't easy to do all this, but there you are. Just keep going- things will change. ",2021-11-18 00:43:44
106,roqbfc,1,Concerned about rapid weight gain,PCOS,"I was just formally diagnosed with PCOS a few weeks ago but have suspected something was up for a while. I’ve gained almost 40 pounds this year and it feels like my doctor kind of…brushed it off. 

In 2020 I lost about 20lbs due to not being able to eat/chronic nausea/gastroparesis and wouldn’t often just not eat or have to heavily restrict myself so that I wasn’t sick for work. I started working from home about a year ago in January, so naturally I expected to gain weight back due to being more sedentary and now being able to eat whatever/whenever and not having to risk being too sick to go to work. I gained weight gradually, fully expected that. However I would say around August I started gaining RAPIDLY with no change in activity or eating habits from the prior 8 months. Even with watching what I eat, not overindulging, etc. I’m still gaining weight SO FAST. I understand I won’t lose weight without activity which I’m working on, but if I’m not stuffing my face with calories wouldn’t it at least…slow it down? I feel like a balloon being blown up with air.

Focus on hormonal balance by getting enough sleep, proper nutrition, some exercise (sustainable) and stress management to restore balance of your body.

My yearly pap is in a few hours and I was wanting to discuss my weight. This is incredibly nerve wracking for me because despite diet and exercise, I'm at my highest weight (300lbs). In the past, my doctor's have implied that I'm lying about dieting and exercise. I'm under a lot of stress because I work in an ED (night shift) and I'm in nursing school. I know that I stress eat but I also never feel full. I just ate a reasonably portioned breakfast about 30 minutes ago and I'm already feeling hunger again. 

I want to discuss getting on metformin or some type of appetite control. I know it's not a magic fix all but I have the right mindset for changing my weight. I've even started working through a Mediterranean style diet cookbook so I lower my saturated fat and simple carb intake. I take a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes a day.

Recently diagnosed here. I've been working on losing weight for around a month and have so far lost 3-4lb. For 5 days a week I've been following a low carb, low sugar diet and trying to remain under 1300 calories. The remaining 2 days I eat as I usually would (still relatively healthy - loads of veggies but with more carbs like pasta). I will admit that exercise isn't great - I have an exercise bike but it keeps breaking so use is limited. I arrive at work at 7:30am and arrive home at 5:30pm. By that time I'm both physically and emotionally exhausted as my job is quite demanding in that way. I also never wake up feeling well rested, so that has a knock on effect during the day! I enjoy walking but by the time I get home from work, it's too dark to go outside by myself for a walk at the moment. 

I weigh 14 stone and I haven't had a period for over a year. I'm really hoping that once I lose a healthy amount of weight, my periods might reappear (not sure if wishful thinking). Although I've only lost a few pounds, I already feel slightly 'flatter' around the middle and my clothes hang a little looser (maybe I was bloated from carbs before??) so I'm eager to keep up/speed up the progress.

I use a tracker app I love if you are interested in that - just PM me. 

I think walking definitely helps, especially after meals to better utilize carbs. I try to go for 2 short walks (10-15 mins) after lunch and dinner if I can, then find work out classes or weight lifting you enjoy - what you enjoy will be the most sustainable :) consistency is key with everything.

So has anyone got any tips on certain exercises to try to help shift the weight?? Or certain foods to avoid maybe?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/p0nvex/losing_weight_solution_to_pcos/,62,"Hi, I was diagnosed with PCOS and it’s true it’s easy to put on weight but! - it’s also not difficult to lose weight for me. 

What works for me is the following: 
• I have a rule of having at least a 12h fast between my dinner and breakfast - usually I eat my dinner before 7pm, and if I feel a bit hungry in the evening I warm up some milk with cocoa. However, I prefer to have 13-15 breaks.
• I don’t eat/drink dairy - only soy/oat/almond/rice milk
• I eat meat (no read meat, preferably fish) only at a company canteen where I have lunch 3-4x a week & there’s no veggie option. otherwise I prefer to eat vegetarian/vegan dishes, and I never buy meat when I’m cooking on my own.
• I always opt for meals with lots of vegetables. I always take salad at the canteen.
• I don’t eat bread - again only at the canteen as I love to dip pieces of bread into my soup hah… otherwise I don’t buy bread/pasta. I love pastry so I very occasionally try some nice piece of patisserie from a local bakery.
• I try to limit sugar but I have something sweet every day - it’s my weakness but by “something” I mean a one or two biscuits or a piece of chocolate that comes with coffee, so not that much anyway.
• I eat lots of fruit - banana/apple/grapes etc as a snack at work (I know some people try to limit fruit because of sugar but I can’t do that… at least at this stage I don’t believe in the need to cut out fruit if otherwise eating healthy)
• I prepare simple meals - I’m not the biggest fan of cooking so I prefer to eat as simple as possible with a “rule” of 5 ingredients max, which means I eat a rather simple oatmeal (oats, banana, non-dairy milk, flax seeds) for breakfast and my other meals mostly consist of rice and vegetables (I am lazy and I have more “sophisticated”/complex meals at work.. although I’m not very demanding in terms of food anyway. Plus I’m single so no need to care about other people in my household )
• I have a rule of exercising at least 30 mins every day - I used to do weightlifting, but since covid I stopped going to the gym and now I do only yoga. During work days I try to exercise at least 30 mins after I wake up, during weekends I do 60-90 mins sessions. (Can recommend YT teachers like Travis Eliot, yoga with Tim, or the down dog app). If possible, I also do cardio (I love cycling but usually I don’t have time for that).
• balance - Im not super strict and I give myself freedom to eat whatever I want (which paradoxically makes me crave less all the “bad” food). On the other hand, when I eat “unhealthy” things or overeat, I try to balance it out with my next meals. For example, recently I was travelling around Belgium for several days and I couldn’t help it but had to try Belgian waffles, fries, chocolate, had some ice cream and I didn’t follow my “12h fast” rule. For that reason I gave myself a 20h fast after my last dinner during the trip (could probably do a longer one, but I couldn’t resist some good soup hah) and now I try to eat some very light meals for the next few days. 
• regular times - if possible I try to eat around the same time. 7am for breakfast, 12pm for lunch, before 7pm for dinner. If I work from home, I eat my dinner before 6pm.

Now, when I see it, it looks like a crazy regime but actually it’s something that came naturally when I stopped obsessing about strict diets and just started to eat the way I felt my best. Might not work for everyone but it does work for me. Suddenly my weight went down, it stopped fluctuating like crazy (now I’m at the same weight for the last 3 months which is a new thing to me) and I’m no longer crazy about food as it made my life (and food decisions) quite simple. 

Also, I used to have IBS-C - it was pretty severe, I did colonoscopy many times, but now my digestive system works like never before. The solution to my IBS-C is most likely not linked to my current diet as it’s been getting better for the past 2 years but recently my digestion has really really improved. So maybe it’s linked a bit!:)

Long story short: I have PCOS and I don’t have issues with weight. I have at least a 12h break between my dinner and breakfast, I eat lots of veg & fruit, I don’t eat red meat and limit other meat, I don’t eat dairy. I limit sweets. I exercise every day. ",2021-08-08 21:54:51

Also genetics play a factor 8n weight gain during pregnancy. I gained 45-50 lbs during all 3 of my successful pregnancies, even though my starting weight was much less each time. 

The baby weighs 5-10 lbs, amniotic fluid weighs some, the moms body increases her blood capacity by 50%, plus extra fat is stored in preparation for breastfeeding. Most lose 15-20 lbs just by giving birth and fluid loss in the first days to weeks. ",2021-10-19 15:02:38

My endocrinologist took me seriously and gave me Ozempic. I’ve lost 30lbs on it in maybe 6.5 months. It’s a slow loss, but it’s the first time I’ve had any kind of hope I could get back to where I was pre-IVF, when I was a lean PCOS-er.

Is that possible? Or am I more likely to gain weight back? (Which is a truly devastating thought. I have a history of ED, and I’m working on all that brain stuff in therapy.)

Wanted to provide my Week 2 update. Today was my second injection of the Wegovey medicine at 0.25mg. So I have two more doses on this level before my doctor will consider increasing me to 0.50mg. I have not been weighed in yet - my next meeting with her is next Friday. I essentially get weighed in once a month.  


I am so delighted to say I have had ZERO side effects. When I took Metformin I was projectile vomiting. Does this medicine make you maybe have some more urgency to run to the bathroom, yeah, it does. But I'm someone who doesn't have a gallbladder (removed in 2016) so that's not something I've had issues adjusting to. Too much grease makes me run to a bathroom so this medicine did not exacerbate that issue. I also have not felt any dizziness. 

If you aren't used to taking an injection it's a little scary but I'm getting used to it! I know this is a newly approved drug so if you have questions I'm happy to try and help

I guess my case is a little bit difficult because of the constant hormonal changes (that results in weight gain) due to PCOS and fatigue, tiredness from Bipolar meds (also depression n stuff). My weight gain also causes my PCOS to become worse and it has become a cycle until now I’m really heavy. Sometimes I feel that my mental health hates me whenever I don’t have energy or don’t eat protein/carb of some sort. My stomach resents me for not eating properly n constantly consuming extremely spicy food (I also have H polyri infection that I’m treating). I’ve had GERD (basically consistent regurgitation) and my lightest weight was 106 lbs (48 kg). I was so thin, pale and my face was of green/purple colour. My limbs were so cold I shivered all the time. As soon as I got out of it (for a while), I had to start taking birth control n also my mental health hit bottom; my weight spiralled out of control. Idk it’s quite a sad post. Recently, I have been pretty sedentary because it’s kinda cold n rainy outside. I am trying to be more active and do a bit of light workout (n cardio/HIIT) although I feel like throwing up every time. I just want to appreciatively ask for any diet / weight loss tips (like what type of food I should eat, a diet or workout plan I can safely follow). I’m sorry in advance but plz don’t feel sad  because of what’s happening to me 😂 it’s ok because it’s like a normal day thing for me really.  I just want to be healthier as I’m too young to struggle this much n I honestly miss my old self a lot. It would also be great for me to start my self-love journey when I’m a bit more in shape to have a good start. Wish y’all a happy day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/qcvqyz/weight_loss_advice_for_someone_with_pcos_gerd/,10,"So it seems to me that you have quite a lot of different problems so I suggest to start by concentrating on a single one and then you can start the journey towards a overall healthier diet for your body.

As someone who also has had GERD and ended up with heartburn so bad I couldn't literally move I'll start with that. Obviously I'm not a doctor so I can't really help you, as a matter of fact if you can afford it see a doctor because I also had to use medication for mine but what helped me was stopping eating any spicy food, no coffee/tea, no chocolate, no tomatoes of any kind, basically nothing too acid or spicy. Give your stomach a break because it can get really painful. Yes it's weird to eat bland food but you need a break since you're having symptoms. After 1 or 2 months you can start slowly integrating these foods in your diet and I emphasize the word slowly. Don't get crazy with it. Learn to listen to your body and see what foods trigger your reflux and stomach acids. For example I've stopped drinking coffee on an empty stomach because it was bad for me. Also but this is obviously very personal reducing my carbs made my symptoms WAY worse, probably because too many fats were sitting on my stomach and it was already quite stressed so I ate more carbs than usual since they are easily digested. Also personal but I've stopped wearing anything high waisted, it kills my stomach. 

Once you got an handle on your reflux you may find a good diet for you, but keep in mind you have to keep it for life because pcos is a chronic condition so you have to find something that's sustainable for you. Generally speaking a good advice is to up your veggies intake, eat more protein and add healthy fats to your diet. Learn how to create a balanced meals. If you still want to eat carbs like cereal pair them with protein, veggies and fat. Don't eat them on their own since for many people with pcos they're not satiating at all so you end up being still hungry. Different people have different bodies so they'll have different results to the same diet, you just have to find one that works for you. There are tons of recipes online if you don't know how to cook meat or fish or eggs!

As for workouts tbh the best work out is the one you can stick to. If you can even just walking 30/40 minutes every day is good though I understand it might be difficult to find the will to do it, especially if you don't want to leave your house/if it's cold. If you don't want to go to the gym (though I highly recommend it since you can do weight lifting and putting on some muscles) even just a short workout at home or yoga is better than nothing. I know it doesn't seem like it but even just a 15 minutes chloe ting workout is a good thing. The aim of exercising is not to lose weight, is to move your body since a sedentary lifestyle is highly unhealthy. ",2021-10-21 16:34:11

Almost 2 years ago i weighed 175 and I did the keto diet after i had gone to a nutritionist and followed her exact diet plan and even going to the gym 5-6 days a week and not losing weight. Right when i did keto i automatically started losing weight and it was amazing. For months when i was doing a calorie deficit and eating 100 carbs a day only and going to the gym i didn’t lose a single pound and kept gaining weight. so doing keto and seeing my weight go down was amazing. Anyways, i got down to 154 and i stopped keto there because i thought i could manage doing just a low carb diet instead and a calorie deficit. My goal was to not gain weight anymore and now just lose weight slowly even if it meant taking forever. Year later and i weighed 179. Again, i was really upset and i knew the only way i could even drop the weight was keto. I did keto again of course and lost weight. Here i am now weighing 189. I don’t know what to do and i don’t want to do keto anymore. I’m so upset because i never thought i’d even ever weigh this much so quickly. I really don’t want to do keto and i’m all out of options.

One possible explanation is that birth control pills suppressed your hormones while you were on it and now your hormones are bouncing back with a bang and that is what is leading to weight gain. 

This did happen in my own case, I gained double of the weight I lost after I came off these pills because my hormones got crazy. I have read that these pills do trigger stress in some women. So stress also makes the hormones worse. 

In my opinion, I don't think you should go back to it because probably that's what caused it and if you go back to it and come off it again things will get bad again.

I really don't want to give a medical advice here but I'd like to help you understand this better.

Summary of what I learnt: So these birth control pills suppress ovulation and that is not good for our health because a woman's body needs ovulation for more than just having a baby for her overall health. 

So I found about these side effects and functioning of birth control pills in these two books:

Wanted to provide my Week 3 update. Yesterday was my second injection of the Wygovy medicine at 0.25mg. My weigh in is tomorrow to see how things are going and I'll reply on here with a weight update.

Honestly still not seeing a LOT of side effects but do find I'm running to the bathroom a little bit more urgently the day after the dose (aka diarrhea).  I don't have any stomachaches or eating issues still. I honestly feel okay and it might be placebo but I feel less tight in my own skin - you can say that's bloating or not bloating but I feel like something is happening even if the weight doesn't reflect it yet.

I also just had my IUD put in last Monday and I've been off my antidepressants for 3 weeks. Both these choices are tangential but were made to help with weight management. My husband and I don't want children and I was encouraged to get the IUD for a consistent low dose MIGHT help my weight management (not guaranteed), but we have seen birth control does cause weight gain. The anti-depressants are known to cause weight gain and I also mentally feel healthy enough to start that transition off of them.

Did any of you manage to reverse it? What was your secret? I wouldn't like to stay on a diet my whole life, would like to escape that hamster wheel of diet industry but I don’t see the way. 
Thank you for any answer in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/pnoi0p/was_anyone_here_successful_with_intuitive_eating/,8,"I'm also doing intuitive eating. Sounds that you have hit the diet bottom. Have you ever read the Intuitive Eating book and get familiar with the principles? Reading the book first can be helpful. Also, when you talk about success, what do you mean? It's certainly not for weight loss because HAES is against intentional weight loss. Improvement of fertility? Getting rid of insulin resistance? Preventing type II diabetes when you get older? You said you had trouble moving around. What exactly is that? Don't blame weight for everything because it can prevent you to see the true nature of your problem. In other words, what if a person with a smaller size has the same problem as you do? 

I did a quick research on Google Scholar and tried to find academic research on the relationship between insulin resistance and binge eating. Although a correlation is shown, none of them suggests that insulin resistance causes binge eating. Instead, many suspect it may be the other way around because of food types people typically binge for (diet culture's fault, again). I don't get where the myth that insulin resistance causes binge eating comes from. ",2021-09-13 21:09:51

I am an athletic person, have been all my life. I do a 40 minute HIIT workout at least 4 days a week and I walk 25 minutes to work and back each day.  Average around 8,000 steps a day.

159,pwwa3v,10,Could it be gluten?,PCOS,"I received my PCOS diagnosis when I was just 15, around 2015. I've been on birth control since then, and a participant in a multitude of diets; keto, vegan, low carb, CICO, you name it. CICO was probably the most disappointing, as many people nowadays are claiming it is a 'one size fits all' kind of diet; the answer to anyone's weightloss troubles. 

Unfortunately, as I'm sure you can all relate, I would set my threshold at 1000 calories a day (a dangerously low amount) and still not lose *any* weight. In fact, there were some days I'd find I even *gained* a pound. I'm 193lbs and 5'2 so I've got the extra weight, but can never seem to shed it. I remember even doing CICO while working out 3 times a week, for a solid 2 months--nothing changed with my weight. Then, I started to do further research, and just happened to stumble across a Tik Tok of a woman with PCOS who explained that she was managing her symptoms with a gluten and dairy free diet. Now I'd say that dairy is probably difficult for any adult to digest, but gluten? I know that I'm what they call 'gluten sensitive' because I have the 'gluten rash' as well as a positive indicator for it on my food sensitivity test. But I never thought it was so serious that I might consider cutting it out completely. Well it turns out that gluten also really exacerbates the already present inflammatory issues we have as people with PCOS. 

So I went gluten free. On my first day I noticed the subtle absence of the constant bloating that I experience on a day to day. I checked my weight the next morning and sure enough I had dropped a full pound. I have no idea where it'll go from here, I'm only on my third day but already see a big improvement, not just with my weight that's finally budging but also with my overall hunger--I feel satiated on this 'diet'! 

Of course I want to confirm any other potential health abnormalities so I have an upcoming appointment with a doctor. Hopefully they'll also be able to monitor how my body responds to this dietary change. Anyways, just thought I'd introduce the idea of possibly going gluten free to anyone else considering it! I'll try and update you guys in a month about where I am with the lifestyle change :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/pwwa3v/could_it_be_gluten/,10,"I have lean PCOS, so this doesn’t necessarily directly correlate, but I just found out I was celiac a few months ago. It causes weight loss, inflammation, low iron, and PCOS symptoms. 

I often think a lot of women on here (particularly lean PCOSers) sound like they have the same symptoms as I did, most of which were not GI related. I wouldn’t be shocked if gluten sensitivity (non celiac) could still present with PCOS symptoms but weight gain rather than loss, because you have all the inflammation without the structural damage of celiac causing malnutrition. 

I will say, hunger pangs shortly after eating is now my warning sign that I’ve accidentally ingested gluten, which is interesting in retrospect. I’d often sooth the hunger pangs by reaching for / craving something carb-y, like potatoes or pasta (which obviously exacerbated the problem). I’m sure if I was able to absorb what I was eating I would have gained too much weight (celiac causes malabsorption).

That might also explain why not everyone responds to going off gluten, as its not something that causes everyone’s PCOS. The causes of PCOS are diverse and complicated, and it’s important to see PCOS as an umbrella term for many different conditions that share the same symptoms. 

Aside from that, I remember hearing the term “wheat belly” as a term for “stubborn” midsection weight that doesn’t go away even with weight loss and healthy diet. I never had any experience with this, but I can say that because I’m celiac, my boyfriend who I live with has also had to go strict gluten free. He has had issues with weight his whole life, along with the stubborn midsection, and his weight melted off. He’s eating the same food and calories he always did, just gluten free versions (he eats a lot of junk). He hasn’t been this weight since high school. There’s definitely something to it if you’re one of the few who suffers from issues with wheat. Just a heads up that most oats have a ton of gluten in them from cross contamination as well! 

However, not everyone with PCOS needs to go off gluten! If it bothers your body, it can be a route to try for sure. Good luck to you! ",2021-09-28 02:12:23

161,pnlw4x,14,I started a PCOS accountability group. Here's how is going.,PCOS,"On Sept 6, I started an accountability group alongside 3 other women. Here is how the group came together and how we are working towards managing PCOS.

It all started with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/p1o6n8/i_am_putting_together_an_accountability_group/) to recruit like-minded women looking to support each other. More than 50 people expressed interest, 10 screening calls were scheduled and from that, 3 women joined the group. Why such a dramatic decrease from 50 to 10? Many people who were initially interested wanted to remain anonymous, others were on a different journey in their PCOS, or at too different timezones.

After the members were selected, we had a group call to meet each other and kickstart the group. Here are some key activities and strategies:

* We are using **Slack** for async communication. We considered Discord, but most of us were already familiar with Slack.
* We use 4 categories: **fuel** (for everything related to food), **sweat** (for exercise and general movement), **sleep**, and **self-care**.
* We set **weekly challenges** for each category. This is the frequency that has worked for me in the past. Easy to re-adjust week over week.
* We set up a deadline for Dec 6, 3 months after our starting day. This is because I read online that resetting female hormones take 90 days.
* Language is important, hence the names for the categories and the name of the group is ""Energy Tribe"". I believe that changing our mindset to see food as fuel, look to break a sweat, be mindful of sleep, and incorporating self-care every day is the key to lasting behavioral change.

166,qglhno,3,"Looking to understand androgen and weight gain, can't take estrogen",PCOS,"I was diagnosed with PCOS at 14 and have had great results on estradiol type birth control 35mcg, spironolactone 50mg, and metformin ER 2000mg total daily for 17 years.  After starting the meds and my diet that I've been on since age 14,  I lost 130 pounds.  In February I had migraine aura for the first time (apparently this is not uncommon in people who have history of migraine headache and covid).  So my estrogen pill was replaced with Slynd because the pill plus aura (plus family history plus having had covid) makes the stroke risk too high.  Everything else stayed the same except that we added baby aspirin into the daily mix.

Fast forward 8 months and I've gained a 40 pounds and haven't had a period this whole time, where I never missed a period since 14.  I'm not pregnant.  My doctor has suggested ovary removal but I don't understand the science behind it.  He seems to feel it's the next step but given that it's not reversible I'd like to understand how it will affect my body.  I've looked up info but can't find anything specific about weight gain/loss in women with PCOS and how it relates to the ovaries.

First, reproduction is not a concern.  My lack of periods is not a concern (I love not having periods!) aside from the fact that it's a likely sign that my PCOS is not well controlled.  My main concern with the way things are is my new weight, since I don't feel comfortable in my own skin and since I have a family history of weight related issues.  My concern with having the procedure is that I could have issues balancing hormone therapy to feel like myself, and also possibly not have any benefit as far as weight.  The doctor suggests the surgery as a way to ""control"" the PCOS and the hormone level in my body, not as a solution to the weight issue.

Information online says women often gain weight after having ovaries removed, but that's not specific to women with PCOS. However, I've also read that the reason insulin resistance in PCOS causes weight gain is because it ramps up androgen production, which happens in the ovaries.  So if the ovaries are removed, would it remove the big cause of weight gain (androgen), or just the cause of the belly fat - and would I still be likely to struggle just as much with weight, but with the fat not focused on the belly?  I'm sorry if these are silly questions  - I'm not dumb but I was never good at biology.  Is there an area aside from the ovaries that would continue to produce androgen?   How does the insulin resistance process look when androgen isn't in the picture (eat sugar, insulin is produced, isn't absorbed so more is produced, what happens then if androgen doesn't enter the picture?).

Any help or resources specific to the role of ovarian hormone production in the storing of calories for people with PCOS would be much appreciated, or recommendations for where I can find a specialist to speak with this about (since my OBGYN doesn't really seem to know specifics except for that this is the next step).  Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/qglhno/looking_to_understand_androgen_and_weight_gain/,3,"Androgens in females are produced by the ovaries, but also by the adrenal glands. So the removal of the ovaries does reduce the production of androgens but depending on the balance of hormones within your body it still may not be enough to correct all your problems.

You’re correct that insulin resistance plays a role in PCOS and that excess androgens restrict the metabolism of glucose in your cells. Increased insulin in your cells can mimic the action of LH(luteinizing hormone) lead to an even greater disruption of the ratio between LH and FSH(follicle stimulating hormone). An imbalance in the ratio of LH and FSH is typical of PCOS and is involved in an increased production of androgens. 

Therefore this loop is created in which high androgens increase insulin resistance and insulin resistance increases androgens. And without getting to the root of your insulin resistance it will be very difficult to lose weight and get control over your other PCOS symptoms such as period loss. 

I’d recommend asking your OBGYN to refer you to an endocrinologist who specializes in hormones. In the mean time I’d suggest trying intermittent fasting as it is the quickest way to increase your sensitivity to insulin and get a handle on your symptoms. I have had suspicions for years that I have PCOS but until recently, was never formally diagnosed. I haven’t had a period in three years, have hormonal acne and stubborn weight that I can’t seem to lose. I have always read that intermittent fasting can help but never took the chance to try it until two weeks ago. After the first week I got my period back, I’m now at the end of my second week and I have lost 5 pounds and my acne has reduced. I would definitely recommend giving it a try as it has been the only thing that has worked for me! ",2021-10-27 01:36:14

Diagnosed at 15 when borderline overweight and somehow shed 20+ kilos through diet alone even when fully vegetarian. It was low carb, zero processed sugar to be fair. At 21, put on a bit of extra weight which again came off with 4km of walking a day and then was in the best shape of my life with weight training (5x5 training) and walking on the off days. Since 2018, I have been gaining weight and was at the point of getting it under control (was gf, df and vegan!) when in mid-2020, amidst a very stressful home move, I ended up finding myself 10 kilos extra. Now hovering at 75 kilos on a 5’4” frame, completely needing a wardrobe overhaul and feeling sick of that midriff fat, chunky thighs and the debilitating brain fog. 

I have been consistently doing yoga for the past month and a half, eating clean and the scales wont budge. Before that did some home workouts with dumbbells (Caroline Girvan’s programme was goood!) but no shift in the weight and I just kept finding the HIIT-style lifting a bit not my thing. Even before that stuck with Chloe Ting and found no result even though I was drenched in sweat and felt so good from the workout. 

I am thinking of going back to the gym and getting back on the 5x5 training plan and combine it with the yoga/daily walks and clean eating.

Others find they need to more directly target insulin to see improvement, even after significant weight loss - lowering carbs, supplements or metformin, IF, etc. 

If you target insulin sensitivity you will see symptoms improve, possibly reverse. Many of us have seen our health improve by increasing protein and high fiber green veg and lowering sugar and starch. I aim for 30g+ of protein per meal and my hair not only grew back but is thicker now than when it started shedding. Inositol has been a game changer for many - helps with hunger and cravings, insulin sensitivity, hirsutism and is independently good for hair. Good luck!

I also sometimes feel really heavy and groggy during the time period of the bloating, and it lasts a really long time. Like 4-6 hours, but my bf and friends who don't have PCOS typically only bloat a couple inches or so and it goes away after an hour, so I feel really fat and awkward when I eat around them.

199,ppiq7m,3,"Dropping weight, negativity, and finally taking charge of my health 10 years later [long]",PCOS,"Hey all, I've been lurking here and other communities lately that have really motivated me on my journey and I hope this helps others too. In a way, finally confronting myself and taking the steps to change is cathartic and gives me hope for the future--that I will heal and there will be brightness ahead.

I was diagnosed with PCOS at 18 and have been living with it for 10 years now. I did try at first to manage it with diet, exercise, and meds, but it was so tough and I got discouraged easily. After a while I guess I just... gave up... and it slowly took over my mind/life.

My weight kept ballooning, I was losing hair, and my mood/mentality was worsening. I focused on other things in my life like stressing over my career, which probably worsened my symptoms, and trying to do something to change my situation without actually addressing the main thing that was making me so unhappy with myself, which was my PCOS. I stopped caring and stopped taking my medication regularly at times because I felt it wasn't making any difference.

Along the way, I met a truly supportive, loving, good man who saw the brightness in me despite how my own vision was clouded in darkness. For 6 years he stood by me, but I became a monster and hated myself and took that hatred out on him. I hated how I looked so we stopped taking pictures, and I didn't want him to touch me because I was afraid he'd see how ugly I was and leave me. I pushed him away, and in a way it came true, because I became that ugly negative monster and everything broke apart. I felt like something needed to change but didn't realize it was me. I'm so sorry.

For the year following, I was at my lowest point. I became an emotional eater and developed an eating disorder (bingeing/bulimia). I avoided looking in mirrors to the point where I covered them up. I hated myself. I was at my heaviest this summer, pre-diabetic, balding, fatty liver, at risk of heart disease, depressed, alone, and staring at myself in the fitting room mirror of a clothing store upset because nothing fit or looked good.

Something snapped then. I realized the only person who would stay with me for the rest of my life was me, and I had been living too long in this darkness. PCOS affected me to the point where I had spent nearly a decade sabotaging myself, destroying relationships, and spiraling downward. I let myself become a passenger in my own body, and I was tired of living like this.

In August I began my journey in earnest. I started intermittent fasting, cutting out carbs/sugars/sugary drinks, focusing on protein and veggies. I don't count calories but I have a general idea and am limiting portion sizes-- but it's definitely much better and a deficit compared to what I was doing before. I started taking some inositol, but at half the recommended dose for now. I work out 5 days a week usually 30 minutes of cardio then an hour of weight lifting, focusing on different muscle groups every day. I found a personal trainer who is kind, understanding, and enormously generous with his support--and keeping accountable to him is my motivation to stay strong during the week.

Yesterday, I weighed in almost 15 lbs lighter. I could have cried. I don't need to tell you ladies that losing weight with PCOS can feel nigh on impossible... but I was doing it. I AM doing it. I know most of it is water weight, but I'm still so proud of this change. I am stronger these days and don't get winded as easily. My energy levels are also higher, and sometimes I feel like I really am ready to take on the future.

But, probably more importantly, I'm learning to take charge of my mental health and battle the demons that kept me from changing before. This, I think, is the greatest determinant of my motivation. I still find myself drowning sometimes in my guilt, regrets, anxiety over the years I wasted and all the opportunities/relationships I've ruined, but I'm learning to fight it by practicing mindfulness, yoga, meditation. I'm reaching out to close friends and being honest with them about my journey, rebuilding my support systems. I'm channeling my energy through exercise, being in nature, and creative hobbies like keeping a journal. When I get the money, I plan to reach out to a therapist also.

By learning to take control of my nutrition and health, mentally and physically, I'm learning to forgive myself. I can't go back to the past and rewrite the beginning, but I can change the ending. For 10 years this hung over me, but no more. I want to look back at myself a year from now and be proud of how far I've come. I will learn to love myself, have hope for the future, find happiness and feel the sunshine on my face again.

To the man I realized too late how much I loved you, I know we can no longer start anew... We ended painfully, but you ultimately helped inspire me to change myself to become the person you always believed me to be. Thank you forever for the warmth you showed me during my darkness. I wish you nothing but happiness.

To all of those who read this post and are going through a similar journey, I'm here with you. We can do this. We will have good days and very difficult days. But no matter what, we can keep going, and we'll be here for each other. Thank you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/ppiq7m/dropping_weight_negativity_and_finally_taking/,18,"Yay!

Just so you know, the general recommended dose of inositol for PCOS is 4 g per day in 2 doses of 2g but the doses for mental health - depression, anxiety and bipolar are higher, 12-18 g per day. So a bit more than you are taking may be even more helpful. Many people with these issues and/or with PCOS are actually low on inositol, one theory is that we metabolize it more quickly resulting in a deficit.

I'm not officially diagnosed with PCOS but I have always assumed I have it too based on my symptoms. I'm not really suffering much from it: I don't want children, I'm improving to manage my anxiety, and my PCOS symptoms are not directly visible to others. 

I've recently been trying to lose weight however, because that is the one thing I struggle with most. Until today, I didn't know weight loss is more difficult for people with PCOS and it might explain why even though I'm on an easy diet and intermittent fasting and exercising for two months, I am not losing any weight!

212,ppdder,5,"Diagnosed with PCOS in May, lost 20 pounds since but have hovered at the same weight for six weeks now.",PCOS,"I (35F) have been doing a low carb(ish) diet and focusing on a calorie deficit. I see a dietician and she calculated my calorie goal to be 1800-1900 a day based on my height (5’9”), current weight (244), and activity level (150 minutes cardio/weights a week). 

I have been hitting my calorie goal every day for six weeks. Often I’m only in the 1600s. I do eat carbs, but I avoid white flour, sugar, and rice. I try to stay under 120g a day, based on my dietician’s suggestion. 

I’ve hovered around 244.7 for six weeks despite hitting my calorie goals and exercising 5 days a week for 30 minutes a day. I had my period two weeks ago and dropped down to 242.7 on Monday so I thought the scale was finally moving but I weighed myself this morning and I’m right back to 244.7. 

I’m getting so frustrated. The diet and exercised obviously worked for the first 20 pounds but why am I stuck here now? If it’s a plateau, what can I do to switch things up?

I got a Libre 2 to check my glucose levels for the next two weeks and so far my glucose averages around 112mg/dL, which is prediabetic, no? It will go down to the 80s when I do cardio but an hour later is back up to 112. 

I take a multivitamin, magnesium, vitamin D, myo- and D-chiro Inositol, plus a probiotic everyday. 

Should I try lowering my carb intake more? I try to eat low-glycemic carbs but maybe I’m eating too many? My exercise includes a spin bike for cardio mixed with outside walking and free weights.

Like the stomach fat is going away and I’m getting into shape. I wonder why I still weigh the same. Either that or I weighed more than I thought. I don’t check the scale very often.

Since female bodies are more sensitive to calorie restriction than men are, fasting for long periods can affect the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates your body's hormones. Under stress, cortisol elevates, as does estrogen, so as your body gets used to utilizing fats for fuel, it can release hormones that disrupt your cycle.”

P.s some people swell a lot when their exercise. If you’re the type of person who is prone to getting swollen hands and feet or legs, then it’s even more likely you will retain water when you work out as your body is trying to repair tissue damage.  Every time I gym it consistently I get really bloated and fat and give up.

220,poe6z8,3,How to stop emotional eating?,PCOS,"Hi everyone! Although I’ve always struggled with PCOS symptoms, I didn’t get an official diagnosis till I was 27 (last year). For the past ten years, my weight has fluctuated greatly. In that time span, I can’t say I committed to a healthy lifestyle for a full year. In 2019, I went from 185 to 159. I had been going back and forth between 170-185 for the previous couple of years. I’m at my heaviest now, 205. I feel so ashamed of myself. I was untreated, so my dietitian recently recommended ovasitol. This is my third day taking it so I of course can’t tell yet.

The reason I wanted to reach out is because  I have struggled with emotional eating for a while now. The past year, I found myself taking laxatives in the form of tea after each binge episode. I had my first meeting with my dietitian last week because I realized what I was doing was extremely unhealthy and at times causing me great pain. Aside from PCOS, I have also struggled with depression greatly. I recently moved to a new city to return to school. This should be an exciting time because severe depression caused me to fail many semesters, yet I guess I’m struggling with feelings of loneliness, uncertainty, and home sickness. I literally just bough two cookie ice cream sandwiches. And the whole time I’m thinking, is this really a good idea? I’m aware of the self sabotage yet convince myself I deserve it this one time. But you know, it’s not just a one time thing with me.

Sorry this is so long. Just needed to vent I guess but also want any advice to end emotional eating. I feel like crap, out of breath and just not happy with my body. I’m 5’2. Most of the excess weight goes to my stomach and boobs. Thank you for reading everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/poe6z8/how_to_stop_emotional_eating/,6,"this is more of a psychological thing than a metabolic one, as I'm sure you probably know! obviously I don't know your story but I do know it's often driven by unresolved emotional trauma or conflict. even having your food restricted as a kid can do it. it's not your fault, it can be a survival mechanism that just gets applied inappropriately by your lizard brain. for a lot of people, their bodies want to feed themselves when they feel insecure or threatened... start by working through why that might be.

therapy can help a lot... it's hard to improve your physical health when you're struggling with the mental side of things. take care of yourself from that perspective first, and show yourself the same compassion you'd show to other people. ",2021-09-14 23:25:33

222,nwf1p4,46,my boyfriend's family has made comments about my weight and lifestyle,PCOS,"I'm really hurt. My boyfriend hasn't always been very sensitive about the fact that I'm plus sized. I personally am insecure about my body and I'm aware that I'm not really his ""type."" Regardless, there have been a lot of moments where he has loved my body and my insecurities. 

His mom noticed I gained weight in the middle of the pandemic when I went to go stay with them for a while and told my boyfriend discreetly that I've put on weight and that it's a bit unhealthy for me.  

My boyfriend told me this yesterday and I cried out of sheer embarrassment. I guess I convinced myself it didn't look as bad as it was. I actually (after I processed ) felt like she was saying this out of concern for me, and felt more motivated to begin a healthier lifestyle with more dedication. 

I am pretty sedentary with my current job. It's high stress and WFH (I work almost 60-70 hours a week) in healthcare)  and i've had several bouts of depression throughout the past two years which has caused me to be the heaviest I've been. I wake up, I log in to work, I work until 5, I'm exhausted, I take a break and watch a show or sort of take a nap, and then I keep working until 2 AM. I keep trying at least twice or three times a month to change all this and I'm struggling to lose weight. Today I tried to put my foot down on myself when I heard what his mother said about me several months ago.  I started a healthy diet, I signed up at the gym. I called my mom for low carb recipes, I started logging in my fitness pal. I ate healthy and intermittent fasted, which I've been struggling with a LOT. I was proud of myself. 

&#x200B;

Today (and yesterday when he told me what his mom said) my boyfriend complained I have a hard time talking about physical fitness and complained about our compatibility and implied that his dad didn't think I was a good long term partner for him (because of my lifestyle choices). He complained that I don't even share that I'm doing anything for my physical fitness progress. I don't like talking to him about my physical fitness goals. I feel so uncomfortable. He frequently talks about getting abs and getting sexy and skips meals to lose weight and then eats poorly and then starves himself. It is really triggering for me when he does this. He keeps asking me how much I weigh (since we got together 3 years ago, even when I was losing weight) and I keep dodging the question. The question is extremely triggering for me. It didn't matter how much I weighed, I was 105 pounds and my parents would shame me for my weight, force me to get on a scale, shame me, forcefully drive me to the gym. I eventually told him all this despite the fact I've told him I felt uncomfortable disclosing how much I weigh. I always try to say why does this matter, it has nothing to do with you, are you asking because you don't like the way my body looks etc, and even though he says it doesn't have to do with how I look, he just feels like he should know as my partner. Idk. It gets turned around on me that I'm not meeting his needs about transparency and honesty or something. He's matter of factly said I was fat. Which sucked, but he said it wasn't an insult, it didn't mean I wasn't attractive to him, I just was fat.  And I'm becoming more accepting of that descriptor. 

&#x200B;

I've lost 40 pounds before, I've worked out a lot. I've been fat shamed my entire life by my mom who has an undiagnosed eating disorder, my sister who has always been very thin developed bulimia because of the way my mom acts. 

&#x200B;

I can't believe his dad said that about me. That he should be with someone who is more active, he didn't even express any like concern for me as someone who has spent the last three years with his son and tried to develop a relationship with him.  As if I have nothing else to offer. I just spent the entire friday (my first day off in months) helping a friend safely through a mental health crisis from a different state, while also taking work calls. I've stuck it out with him through thick and thin, I've forgiven his son for a lot, I've been so patient with his son. He (my bf) knows I have PCOS. He doesn't understand how easy it is to gain weight with PCOS. He didn't even seem to say anything like ""dad, thank you for your concern, I care about my girlfriend's health, and that's between me and her,  it's none of your business."" He just reiterated it back to me like it just backed up what he already felt. I was so proud of myself for making it through the last few weeks and starting a healthy day today and now i just feel like someone pissed all over my parade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/nwf1p4/my_boyfriends_family_has_made_comments_about_my/,49,"I’m going to be honest: RED FLAGS, galore.

Your boyfriend seems to have some serious self-image issues, and is projecting unto you. He may be so invested in your weight because he is upset  about not obtaining his own goals, and you have become a way to deflect. To be honest, it wouldn’t shock me if his parents did not say those things at all. Perhaps he is stirring things up in an effort to “motivate” or impact you.

I’m not going to read into your relationship, or assume to know whether he is a great partner or not. But this particular bit doesn’t read well. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 16 years, and I have never told him my weight. Not once. He asks with a smile, knowing I won’t tell, but would never in a million years be angry or feel entitled to know.

* not taking metformin (been off that medication for 3 years now)
* drinking 100+ oz water a day 
* focus on portion control and lean and green meals per Optavia plan
* Eating high protein, low carb foods every 2-3 hours 
* incorporating a LOT more vegetables into daily meals 
* cardio and strength training 3-4 times a week— free weights, peloton biking and kickboxing with a heavy bag doing 30 min HIIT workouts
* If I have to snack— stick to a handful of raw nuts or a portion of a protein bar (I try to avoid crackers, but sometimes I have the high fiber Wasa crackers with a wedge of low fat laughing cow cheese)
* if I want to have a cheat meal or snack, always drink 20-25 oz water beforehand to avoid overeating (salty tasty foods are by design meant to make you want to consume, consume and before you know it, you’ve eaten that whole plate of appetizer nachos or loaded French fries)

This is apparently common for women with PCOS. So now, as another strategy, I'm putting more effort into balancing my hormones through supplements that will lower my estrogen levels/stop the excess conversion of DHEA to estrogen. Before realizing this, cutting out gluten and dairy helped only a little bit with bloating and acne, but not at all with my weight management. And during the time I restricted those foods, my weight increased and my blood tests were still showing the estrogen dominance. Maybe consider getting some blood tests done, so you don't go too deep into the rabbit hole like me for 2 years 🤦‍♀️ ",2021-08-24 21:32:48

First of all, thank you so much for all the posts and answers, it has helped me a lot! I feel less alone with having pcos.

Like the title says, I have underweight and I'm trying to gain weight, but I'm completely confused on how to do that. I have stopped taking bc 3 months ago and my periods have stopped. So I'm trying to get my periods back naturally by minimizing carbs and sugars, but I do want to gain in weight.

Any ideas what pcof proof food I can eat to gain?

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/peesvu/underweight_and_pcos/,2,"So I do want to say the reason people advocate for carb minimization is because of the high rates of insulin resistance for people who are diagnosed with PCOS. I don't know if you have it or not. There are nutritionists that specialize in diabetes and blood sugar management. I say that because they can provide resources on how to pair carbs with other foods that is compatible with insulin resistance. If people with diabetes can eat carbs, then people with insulin resistance can eat carbs. You would also have to find antidiet resources because otherwise everything is like geared towards weightloss. 

If you want to gain weight, limiting one of our three macronutrients seems counterintuitive. So that's why I advocated for looking for a nutritionist/dietician who focuses on blood sugar management. ",2021-08-30 09:42:41

I am struggling with weight as many of us with PCOS do.

Any diets that worked for anyone? Any exercise regimes? 
I was thinking intermittent fasting + something else. Any tips anyone has for me?
I also suffer from pcos.  I would have liked to try keto but will be very dissapointed if I gain the weight quickly back.  My main issue is losing weight from my face.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/pxjn3y/desperate_to_lose_weight/,0,"The reason people recommend Keto is because your aren’t eating carbs with raise your blood sugar and then insulin. You may have heard of the Glycemic Index which rates food based on how they raise your blood sugar. There is actually an Insulin Index as well this is important because you are likely producing too much insulin (the fat storing hormone). Try tracking in a app like MFP for 5 days without restriction. Look at what your eating at the end of the 5 days. If you haven’t gained/lost like is likely your maintenance calories. Lower your calories by 300 kcal this is a sufficient deficit. Then look at the food chooses; what is an easy substitute that has less of an insulin response? You may be surprised to know that skim milk is worse than whole milk or red meat has a higher insulin response than most fruit. A good internal gage for this is do you feel immediately hungry 2 hours after you eat this food, are you craving something salty after something sweet and never can be satisfied or maybe you feel tired after eating foods that are suppose to give you energy. This likely means a food has raised your insulin. There will be times when you body just needs sugar and no amount of monk fruit sweetener or wholesome meals are gunna cut it; these are deeply rooted primal urges that no will power cannot contend with. For me the first signs of this are I haven’t eaten all day and I get a headache. It may be wise to get a blood glucose monitor from the pharmacy to test when you may be going low blood sugar. To avoid these instances try to have your first meal be at least 600kcal and 3 consistent meals in total with no snacking in between. 
Most importantly you need someone outside of yourself to hold you accountable. Someone who is objective and not a family member or spouse bc they are gunna need to give you tough love sometimes. When I was doing Dr. Bernstein this was the nurses and later I hired a online coach I would report too. The truth is we often keep the commitments we make to other people more than ourselves. 
I know 20 pounds can seem like a lot especially on your small frame but you can totally do this. With healthy weight loss being one pound a week you can have this done in 5 months. That time will pass either way whether you are working towards your goals or not. ",2021-09-29 00:22:03

I wasn't diagnosed with PCOS until my mid 30s (I'm old now, 47f).  It turns out that I wasn't so much lazy and terrible, as my body was literally fighting against me!  I'm (like another poster) on the full dosage of Metformin a day and have been for over a decade.  I am currently 70 pounds down from my highest.  (I lost 90 pounds, but then had a baby, and gained most of it back postpartum.  Lest you think too highly of me, my baby in now 10.)

The other thing I didn't learn about myself until I was almost 40, is that I have most of my energy in the morning.  On the weekends, I get up and do everything I want to do first thing.  During the weekday, once I come home from work and make dinner, I'm pretty much drained of energy.  So there is no way that I am going to be able to make myself exercise after my daughter is in bed.

So I try and get a 10-15 minute walk or exercise in the morning, or during my lunch hour.  I also try to do a bunch of meal prep, on the weekends.  I so likely to want to grab fast food or unhealthy convenience food for dinner, because I'm tired and don't feel like cooking.  But it takes very little effort to heat up a healthy casserole or homemade soup.

Lastly, anybody worth being in your life, will understand when you tell them about what it's like to deal with PCOS.  Yes, there will be people who are going to think that any overweight person is slobby and lazy and nothing you can do will change their mind. ",2021-08-24 02:51:12

So this would include avoiding breads, pastas, grains, starchy vegetables like potatoes, fruit juices and limiting sugary fruits like apples, grapes and bananas. All cause spikes in your insulin. 

Reducing insulin levels also lowers testosterone production and helps to balance your hormones. If you're looking for a supplement, spearmint tea is excellent at reducing testosterone levels, 2-3 cups or capsules a day. ",2021-07-19 04:08:10
